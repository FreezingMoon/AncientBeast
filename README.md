### 🎓 Intro

**Ancient Beast** is a turn based strategy indie game project played online against other people featuring a wide variety of creatures to acquire, putting them to use in order to defeat your opponents. This project was carefully designed to be easy to learn, fun to play and hard to master. We hope you'll enjoy it!

### 🎮 Gameplay

Create an army out of a variety of units, each with their own unique abilities and stats, and control them in 1v1 or 2v2 combat against bots or other players in this turn based strategy game. Alternate game modes allow for different rulesets to mix up matches to your preference, or to try playing in a new way. Refine your strategies and selection of units and become an adept tactician.

### 📜 Lore
The game takes place in a dystopian future, where people have excelled in power thanks to the use of technology, specifically advanced 3d printers. The world is split into 7 factions, based off the seven deadly sins (Avarice, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, Pride, Sloth, Wrath), fighting each other for resources, land and supremacy. This is not a chance based game; are you skilled enough to survive?

### 💻 Hardware
The game is designed to be lightweight and run on most devices out there as it adjusts on the fly thanks to various optimizations and it will be playable using pretty much any input method you can think of. So far you can play it using mouse, keyboard, touchscreens and pretty soon with gamepads, voice commands, AR/VR glasses and even brainwave headbands.

### 💈 Bottlenecks
Besides the main bottleneck, it's creator, [Dread Knight](https://github.com/DreadKnight) (hence why development decisions will eventually transition to [Freezing Moon DAO](https://FreezingMoon.org)), the game is currently pre-alpha prototype and lacks some important features (for now), such as online multiplayer, bots and unit animations. Given time, with enough love and support all those major issues will be addressed and the game will be able to reach mainstream audiences.

### 🔮 [Roadmap](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/milestone/5)

We're working hard on the next version - 0.5, codenamed `Chimera`.
What we're aiming for are the following:

- 3 new playable creatures
- 3 new epic sound tracks
- one new combat location
- revamping some abilities
- balancing creatures stats
- sound effects for actions
- sprites for ranged attacks
- many user interface tweaks
- lots of usability enhancements
- a ton of bug fixes all around
- partial code base restructuring
- development workflow improvements
- more project lore & documentation
