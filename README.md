### Intro

**Ancient Beast** is a turn based strategy indie game project played online against other people featuring a wide variety of creatures to acquire, putting them to use in order to defeat your opponents. This project was carefully designed to be easy to learn, fun to play and hard to master. We hope you'll enjoy it!

- 3 new playable creatures
- 3 new epic sound tracks
- one new combat location
- revamping some abilities
- balancing creatures stats
- sound effects for actions
- sprites for ranged attacks
- many user interface tweaks
- lots of usability enhancements
- a ton of bug fixes all around
- partial code base restructuring
