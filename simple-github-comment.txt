âœ… FIXED: Boiling Point ability now respects audio mode setting

Issue #2779 - The ability was playing sounds even when muted.

SOLUTION: Added audio mode checking before playing sound effects.

Code changes in src/abilities/Infernal.ts:
- Import getAudioMode function
- Wrap sound call in: if (getAudioMode() !== 'muted')

Testing: Set audio to muted, trigger ability, verify no sound. Set back to full/sfx, verify sound works.

Bounty claim: 5 XTR - Ready for review!
