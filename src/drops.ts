/**
 * Drops are a type of creature "buff" collected from a game board hex rather than
 * being applied by an ability.
 *
 * For "pool" resources such as health and energy, the buff restores those resources
 * as well as increasing their maximum values.
 *
 * Each creature has a unique Drop that is added to their location hex when they
 * die.
 *
 * Another creature entering the same hex as the Drop can pick it up, altering its
 * stats (alterations) and/or restoring health/energy.
 *
 * Other rules:
 * - Multiple Drops can stack on a single creature, either the same Drop multiple
 *   times or different Drops from multiple creatures.
 * - Drops currently do NOT expire.
 * - Drops currently cannot be removed by other abilities.
 * - Drops are essentially permanent although this may change in the future.
