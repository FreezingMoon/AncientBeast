## Github Marketing
You can help out the project by just â˜… starring this repository from the upper right corner and also by pinning it to your profile.

## Getting Started
It's very easy to set-up a local server in order to test and contribute to the development version of the game.<br>
It uses web languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.js. The game engine used is free open source, named [Phaser](http://phaser.io).

### Recommended Tool
If you're not very keen on using git from the CLI, I recomment using [Git Cola](https://git-cola.github.io) for cloning the project and creating patches.

### Fork Project
You can create a clone of the project by using git from CLI or with the use of a tool, like the one recommended above.
```

```

### Package Requirements
First Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org). Linux users: if you installed from repository, you might need to create a path link.

### Grunt Setup
After you've successfully installed the Node.js package, open up a terminal and use the next command:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
```

### Installing Dependencies
Still in the terminal, use the following command in order to easily install all project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

This will read `package.json` and install all of the gameplay established npm package dependencies.<br>
The *npm install* command will also update any required dependencies if `package.json` file changes. If you have not worked on the project in a while, it is good practice to check both npm and bower dependencies before continuing to work again.<br>

If you're using Windows operating system and getting errors, try to `Run as administrator` or to disable your anti-virus.

### Betatest Game

To have the game properly set-up and opened in the default browser, simply run this terminal command:

```
grunt
```
You should only use <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/"><b>Google Chrome</b></a> or <a href="https://www.chromium.org"><b>Chromium</b></a>, as other browsers don't quite cut it. White testing you can right click the game tab and mute it.
Grunt will work in the background so that when you change any game scripts, the re-compile will occur.

## Getting Involved
After you've playtested the development version of the game, there are 2 main ways you can contribute to the project.<br>
For a more comprehensive guide on how to help out the project, you can check out the [Make Your Contribution](https://AncientBeast.com/contribute) guide.

### Report Issues
If you encounter any problems with the version, you can report them to our [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/issues), try to avoid duplicates.<br>
Very often, it will be very helpful for debugging purposes to fetch game logs when encountering issues.<br>
You can use this function from the browser console window in order to fetch the log `G.gamelog.get()`.<br>
To replay a match, you can start a new game and paste the log between brackets of `G.gamelog.play()`.<br>
In order to open up Google Chrome browser's console, you can simply press `Ctrl + Shift + j` hotkeys.

### Patch Game
The main coding language used is Javascript, feel free to create patches and propose them by making a Pull Request.
You should look around on GitHub Issue tracker for open issues, priority being the ones that are assigned to the next [milestone](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/milestones) and are tagged "[Priority](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/labels/Priority)", while also lacking the "[Brainstorm](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/labels/Brainstorm)" tag. You can ping [DreadKnight](https://github.com/DreadKnight) in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/x78rKen) in order to be assigned to something specific, otherwise you can comment on a specific issue in order to receive the green light for it, making sure there's nobody else currently working on the issue or that design hasn't changed and a patch is still required.

### Next Step

You are free to browse [existing issues](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/issues) and comment on the ones that you want to take a swing at in order to make sure the issue is still relevant and that nobody else is working on it. You can also drop by the project's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/x78rKen) and mention your skills and that you're interested in helping out; you'll be assigned to a specific issue. When you're done, simply create a **Pull Request**, note that you might need to pull in from master repository before doing so. Your patches will get reviewed and tested, if there are issues with them you'll receive feedback in order to make corrections, otherwise your pull request will get approved and merged into the master branch and you'll getting you credited for your work.
